   contain the root `toctree` directive.

forgi 0.1
=================================

forgi is a library for manipulating RNA as a graph-like structure, for converting 3D structures to 2D, and for representing 3D structures in a coarse-grain manner. Some examples of its usage can be found in the two tutorials below. Please note that forgi is under development and can be a little unstable. Names and interfaces might change. If you are using this library and something changes to break your work, please do let me know and I'll try and sort it out.
