Make fasta-parsing more stable
------------------------------

**File**: graph/bulge_graph.py

If the user uses a malformatted fasta file, give helpful error messages.

Make from_fasta return a list of bulde_graphs if multiple are present (by calling from_fasta_text).

Is it on purpose, that "N" and "T" characters are not allowed in the sequence?
